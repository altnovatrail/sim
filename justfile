# The coverage goes into coverage/go.out, one Go profile, which the job coverage of .github's shared
# go.yml sends to Codecov (R48 spec; R10). Go counts statements and leaves the tests themselves out;
# a package that no test runs is in it too, its statements at zero. Every test counts for every
# package of the module, -coverpkg=./...: a test of one part runs the code of others, and its lines
# count where they are.

# "Go / targets", "Go / fma-diff", "Go / arm64" and "Go / rules". "Go / arm64" runs this recipe on
# arm64 hardware, then the targets. The recipes test-targets, fma-diff and rules below run the same
# in the container, and same-bits runs all three; CI calls none of them.
